        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>I’m Pyae Phyo Aung, a Senior Web Developer with 7 years of experience building web applications that focus on performance, scalability, and user-friendly design. Over the years, I’ve worked with frameworks like <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> to create everything from ERP systems to AI-powered content platforms.</p>
        <p>One of my recent projects involved working with <strong>Growth Automation</strong> in Bangkok, where I helped develop <strong>SwiftWriter</strong>, an AI platform for content creation. Using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, I designed the front-end and made sure it was responsive and easy to use, helping drive user engagement. I’ve also built websites for logistics companies and developed systems for clinics, food courts, and cashless payments, adapting my skills to meet different client needs.</p>
        <p>What excites me most is creating software that not only solves problems but also provides a smooth and enjoyable experience for users. I love combining creativity with functionality to build applications that make a real difference. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and continue growing in this ever-evolving field.</p>
